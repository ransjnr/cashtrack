# CashTrack Environment Configuration

# Mock Authentication (for development when real API is unavailable)
# Set to 'true' to use mock/offline authentication during development
# VITE_MOCK_AUTH=true

# Note: If VITE_MOCK_AUTH is not set, the app will automatically fall back to
# mock auth when the real API is unreachable, allowing development to continue
